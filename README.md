Aim: 
We need to build a solution for extracting structured information from scanned invoices or invoice images. 

The data we need to fetch is: 
Invoice number, invoice date, GST number, Vendor name, Vendor address, delivery address, Buyer Name, Buyer address, 
item details (including prices, quantity, item codes, discount and taxation), total invoice amount, total tax amount, PO number 

Hint:
These invoices can be of varied formats so rule based data extraction is not feasible
Assume Invoice will be available as JPEG images
Invoices can be multi page
Item details can be in table with or without boundaries
The output should be a json file with key-value pairs could you suggest me for the above problem how to proceed and approach for this problem and 
which technology and library is suitable to solve this.
